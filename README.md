# Circuit Diagrams

## Motivation

There is not a lot of publicly available free to use/share Circuit diagrams in SVG format. 
Some sites that do have this, have horrendous watermarks and ads. In short, I had to create a circuit diagram more than once to use it or could
not reuse without permission/attribution yada yada.
Well we do have [Xcircuit](http://opencircuitdesign.com/xcircuit/), but I feel it has a clunky UI. It took some time to
learn how it works and I personally prefer using draw.io since there is zero to none learning curve so people can contribute and I could
outsource creation of certain diagrams if I get busy or bored.

## What it contains

Circuit diagrams drawn using [draw.io/digrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) which can be exported to SVG, PNG and a host of other formats. 
I try adding the topologies and circuits I use/might use or would want to use in my documentation/notes/reports et cetera.

## Instructions

get done with it.
