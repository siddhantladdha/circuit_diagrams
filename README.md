# Circuit Diagrams

## Motivation

There is not a lot of Public Domain Circuit diagrams in SVG format. 
Some sites that do have this, have horrendous watermarks and ads. Some required share-alike and some involved Non-commercial usage.
I have nothing against that. In fact, majority of my work is CC-SA-NC or some or the other form, but I just want to use and want people
to use a simple circuit diagram without red-tape in their forums posts/questions/reports/documentation et cetera, 
and from personal experience I had to create a circuit diagram more than once to use it in different
projects or in my reports.

There is [Wikimedia Commons Electrical Symbol Library](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Electrical_symbols_library.svg) but using a different
topologies required some amount of red tape. And something like a super source follower was not there at all. 

Why [digrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) (formerly called draw.io)? We do have [Xcircuit](http://opencircuitdesign.com/xcircuit/), 
but I feel it has a clunky UI. It took some time to learn how it works and I personally prefer using draw.io since there is zero to none 
learning curve so people with even no background in circuit design can contribute and I could possibly outsource creation of certain diagrams
if I get busy or bored. There is [TikZ](https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf) but again requires learning curve and installation.

Also, SVG is format which can be used with other tools as well.

## What it contains

Circuit diagrams drawn using [draw.io/digrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) which can be exported to SVG, PNG and a host of other formats. 
I try adding the topologies and circuits I use/might use or would want to use in my documentation/notes/reports et cetera.

## Instructions

1. You will have to enable the Mathematical Typesetting function by going to Extras menu item. This is done so that you can properly use Subscripts,
have proper units with greek letter support.

This is licensed under CC0 and you can read the fine print if you want to. But the following is the summary.
- Use it [Any way you want it That's the way you need it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atxUuldUcfI)
- No attribution required. I would apperciate if word gets out and people contribute, but no pressure. If you are in hurry just use it and
get done with it. Remember! documentation is like doing the dishes, the earlier you do it the better it is, so finish it.
